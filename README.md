# Computational-Physics-Labs

This repository contains the programming assignments completed in the course PHY F313 Computational Physics in Semester 1 2020 - 2021. The course serves as an introduction to numerical methods used in mathematics and physics. 

All programming assignments have been implemented using the MATLAB programming language (Version: R2018b)

 
## Numerical Methods Implemented

 - [**Bisection Method**](Lab%201)
 
 (*24/08/2020*)
 The bisection method is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous function for which one knows two function values with opposite signs. It is also called the 'Binary Search Method'. 
 
 - [**Newton-Raphson Method**](Lab%202)
 
 (*26/06/2020*)
 The Newton-Raphson method is a root-finding algorithm that successively produces approximations to roots off a real-valued function. It starts with the function, its derivative, and an initial guess for the root.
