**Eigenvalues of Wigner Matrices and their distribution**

Wigner matrices are symmetric matrices where each element is selected from the same random distribution. 
Hence, they are random symmetric matrices. Distribution of eigenvalues of such matrices follow interesting properties. 
One interesting property is that the histogram of eigenvalues lies on a semi-circle (called the semi-circle law).

Find out the distribution of the dominant eigenvalues for a N Ã— N random symmetric matrices.
