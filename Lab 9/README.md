**Euler Method and Euler-Croemer Method**

1. Write a Forward Euler method code to solve a system of arbitrary system of N ODEs. 

2. Use Euler method code to solve the equations of a pendulum and this simulate its motion. Does the amplitude grow or remain steady with time? Is the method stable for this system?

3. Now implement the Euler-Croemer method and solve the system of equations using this method. Is there any difference in the result obtained now?
