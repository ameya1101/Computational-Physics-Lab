**Normal Modes of a String**

Find the eigenvalues of the matrix obtained by applying the finite difference method to the wave equation for a string. 

1. **Unform String**
    - Find the fundamental frequency upto 4 significant figures. 
    - Plot the shape of the string y = f(x)

2. **Non-uniform String**
    - Find the fundamental frequency upto 4 significant figures. 
    - Plot the shape of the string y = f(x)
