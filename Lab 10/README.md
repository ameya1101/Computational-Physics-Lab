**Runge-Kutta 2**

1. Write a RK-2 method to solve an arbitrary system of N differential equations. 

2. Solve the system of equations governing the motion of a simple pendulum with some chosen initial conditions. Does the amplitude grow or remain steady with time? Is the method stable for this system?
