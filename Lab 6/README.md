**Power Method**

1. Write a code to compute the largest eigenvalue of an arbitrary NxN matrix matrix using the power method without any normalization. 

2. Modify the code to find the smallest eigenvalue. 

3. Write a code for the normalized power method by normalizing the result after every successive multiplication by the matrix.
