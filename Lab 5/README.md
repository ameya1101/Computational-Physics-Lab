**Jacobi Method**

**Part 1**

Write a MATLAB script to solve a system of equations AX = B, where A is a N X N matrix and B is a N X 1 matrix (both are randomly generated) using the Jacobi iterative method.


**Part 2**

Using the program written above, solve the Kirchoff current equations. (See the accompanying PDF)
