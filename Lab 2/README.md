**Newton-Raphson Method**

Write a MATLAB script to find the roots of an arbitrary function using Newton-Raphson Method.

- Implement this using a MATLAB function. Pass f(x) as a function handle to the function through its argument list. Also
    pass the initial guess x0 and the acceptable uncertainty in the root as arguments to this function.

- Plot the errors in each successive step as a function of the number of iterations.


## Results

The plot of erros as a function of the number of iterations for f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 1 using an initial guess x0 = 1
