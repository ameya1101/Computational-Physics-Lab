**Gaussian Elimination**

Write a MATLAB script to solve a system of equations AX = B, where A is a N X N matrix and B is a N X 1 matrix (both are randomly generated).

Also measure the run time of the Gaussian elimination procedure. Plot this time against the dimensionality of the matrix, N.

**Results**

The plot of the run times as a function of the dimensionality N, where 3 <= N <= 3000
